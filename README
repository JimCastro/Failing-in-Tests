1. I've failed many math exams in my high school years, and here in CSB, I've failed the midterm examination in History by about 5 points. Ugh. To be honest, I didn't really study for that test at all, so I guess 5 points more would've been reason to study even just a little. I didn't understand much about math at all in high school, and my poor memory made me forget about important formulas.

3. The CSB midterm were alright, somewhat easier that my high school exams. Especially the math exams. I should have balanced my free time properly so I could've studied more. So I'm gonna try and arrange my schedule better, and find better study habits.
